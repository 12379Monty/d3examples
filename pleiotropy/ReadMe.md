## Pleiotropy explorer

Ultimately, this will become an interactive visualization for
exploring pleiotropy for a pair of traits (whether they are affected
by a common QTL or by separate QTL).

But at the moment I'm just trying to figure out how to work with
sliders. I'm currently trying
[d3.slider](http://sujeetsr.github.io/d3.slider).
