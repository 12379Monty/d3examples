Linked heatmaps of log likelihoods
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/linked_heatmaps).

For each chromosome, there is a pair of heatmaps depicting two
different log likelihood calculations that ideally should be the same.

Hover over a point to see plots of the cross-sections.
