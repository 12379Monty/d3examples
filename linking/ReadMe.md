## An example that links two plots

This is an example to link two plots with [D3](http://d3js.org),
in response to
[a question](https://twitter.com/keeghin/status/564837801947324416)
posed by [@keeghin](https://twitter.com").

The typical thing I do is to assign a class to points that includes a
data index, and then when hovering over one point, do the action on
all points with the same class.
